# Display Panel for Raspberry 7" Touchscreen

This plate mounts official Raspberry [Pi Touch Display](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/) to the OmniBox.

As the display is quite big, it covers the screw holes on the front body, so I recommend
installing the display first on the front part, before attaching it to the base.

Connect all the wires to the display first, both SPI and power, before mounting it to the plate.

There are two versions available, one is flush with the main body face and one is slightly raised.
The only differences are in the aesthetics and the screw size required.

- Flush version requires four M3x8 screws to mount the display. Both parts are attached to the main body first.
- Raised version requires four M3x16 screws to mount the display. You need to attach the plate first to the main body and then attach the display with the case to it.
